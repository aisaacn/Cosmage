# Cosmage
Cosmage is a 1v1 spellcasting deckbuilder where players combine ingredients in their Cauldrons to cast a variety of spells. 

Players can only use ingredients from their Satchel, which they configure before combat to enable unique playstyles.

The first player to reduce their opponent's Health to 0 wins!
